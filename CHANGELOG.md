# Narada Changelog

This changelog tracks semantic chapters in Narada's development: concepts that became canonical, authority boundaries that changed, operator surfaces that became real, and intentionally deferred work.

It is not a package-level release log. Package publishing changes belong in Changesets.

## Operator Closure

Narada's operator surface was reorganized into named families:

- **Selection**: a canonical selector grammar for bounding operator input sets.
- **Re-derivation**: explicit replay, preview, recovery, confirmation replay, and projection rebuild surfaces.
- **Promotion**: explicit lifecycle advancement through audited operator actions.
- **Inspection**: read-only operator family for observing durable or derived state.
- **Advisory signals**: non-authoritative hints that can influence routing, timing, review, and attention without changing truth, permission, or lifecycle authority.

The chapter clarified that operators are not ad-hoc commands. They are named families with authority boundaries, selection bounds, and explicit relationships to durable state.

Concrete outcomes:

- `derive-work`, `preview-work`, `recover`, `confirm-replay`, and `rebuild-projections` are treated as explicit operator surfaces.
- `ConfirmationReplay` became the generic confirmation-boundary replay operator, with mail reconciliation and process confirmation as family instances.
- `Selector` became the canonical bounded-selection type for fact and derivation surfaces.
- `retry_failed_work_items` became an audited promotion surface for retry readiness.
- `inspection` became the canonical read-only operator family.
- `continuation_affinity` became the first implemented advisory signal, scoped to v1 ordering-only behavior.

Authority clarifications:

- Selection and inspection are read-only and authority-agnostic.
- Promotion is explicit, audited, and authority-classed.
- Recovery and replay share a derivation core but have distinct operator intent and authority framing.
- Advisory signals cannot override facts, leases, policy, decisions, intents, executions, confirmations, or governance.

Deferred:

- Broader routing-signal runtime beyond `continuation_affinity`.
